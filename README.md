# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features
1. **Colored Representation of Steps Being Executed:**
   - **Blue:** Default
   - **Yellow:** Being compared
   - **Red:** Identified as in an incorrect position and to be moved
   - **Green:** In correct position

2. **Controls for Visualization:**
   - Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
   - Data size
   - Generate new data (randomly generates new data)

3. **Time and Space Complexity:**
   Displays the time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

1. **HTML**: Provides the structural foundation of the application, defining the layout and elements displayed on the page.
2. **CSS**: Styles the application, ensuring an appealing and visually engaging user interface.
3. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implements the interactive logic and dynamic behavior of the application, enabling the visualization of sorting algorithms.

These technologies were chosen for their simplicity, accessibility, and efficiency in building a lightweight and interactive web application without requiring additional libraries or frameworks.
